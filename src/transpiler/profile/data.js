	summary: "My journey to programming started with writing matrix inspired batch programs for the cmd. I am now vibing with the AWS serverless cloud architecture. On most days, I'm programming web and mobile technologies. I find writing code to be a cathartic experience and so, will be attempting to code-ify whatever daily mundane task I can find. If not writing code, I'll either be rooting/flashing my old android devices, getting my hands dirty with Linux or a raspberry PI or watching anime.",
